A click dummy for my HCIW2014 project

From March, 7th to 9th 2014 I participated to Healthcare Innovation Weekend (HCIW) in Hamburg. 

HCIW is a Startup Weekend like event, which took part the second time. I pitched the idea of an
easy to read alternative to package inserts. 

This is the click dummy we built during this weekend.
